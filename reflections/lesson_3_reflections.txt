1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your files local ?
When I want to collaborate on a project I own or when I would like to make changes on a project from another system.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Making manual pulls would help in making sure changes are reflected to the local repo from the remote repo with latest code commits and changes.
This can help avoid issues of conflict ...
