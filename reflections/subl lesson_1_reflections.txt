How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it helped me quickly spot the difference in the two files without having to  go through the files separately.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

  one can track changes done to a file ..easily .
  
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs
  
having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros : One can selectively choose to save changes to logical code changes (on functions) to ensure code complies /code runs.

cons: It may have too many changes saved  on different commits that don't make up to logical blocks of code. eg if someone left the 
       
	   code hanging due to a distraction. 
	   
	   
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,

 like Google Docs, treat each file separately?	   
 
 Since some commits require saving files made through interconnected files in the project code eg HTML/CSS/JS
 
 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 
 git log -- gives the history of commits{commit id :date/time : commit message :Author}


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

one can always rollback (checkout) to previous working commits before which the pesent bug was not present.
